file "rawdtmWilhelmusdataset.R" is to create raw document-term matrix, 
file "nrowL1dtmWilhelmusdataset.R" is to create nrowl1 document-term matrix, 
file "nrowL2dtmWilhelmusdataset.R" is to create nrowl2 document-term matrix, 
and file "tfidfdtmWilhelmusdataset.R" is to create tfidf document-term matrix. 
These are stored in the "created data\created matrix" folder. These matrices are the same as calsa-tc/Wilhelmus data fold in/created data/created matrix.
These codes are same as the code at calsa-tc/Wilhelmus data fold in/code/Wilhelmus create matrix.
